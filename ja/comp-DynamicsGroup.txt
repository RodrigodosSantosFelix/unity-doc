!! Component Details

!!! Physics Control
* [[class-Rigidbody|Rigidbody]] - Rigidbodies put objects under physics control.
* [[class-ConstantForce|Constant Force]] - A utility component that adds a constant force to a rigidbody. Great for rockets and other quick functionality.

!!! Colliders
* [[class-SphereCollider|Sphere Collider]] - use for sphere-shaped objects.
* [[class-BoxCollider|Box Collider]] - use for box-shaped objects.
* [[class-CapsuleCollider|Capsule Collider]] - use for capsule-like (a cylinder with hemisphere ends) objects.
* [[class-MeshCollider|Mesh Collider]] - takes the graphical [[class-Mesh|mesh]] and uses it as a collision shape.
* [[class-PhysicMaterial|Physic Material]] - contains settings allowing you to fine-tune your object's physical properties (friction, bounce, etc).

!!! Joints
* [[class-HingeJoint|Hinge Joint]] - Used to make door hinges.
* [[class-SpringJoint|Spring Joint]] - A spring-like joint.
* [[class-FixedJoint|Fixed Joint]] - Use to "lock" objects together.
* [[class-ConfigurableJoint|Configurable Joint]] - Use create complex joint behaviors of virtually any kind

!!! Special Function
* [[class-CharacterController|Character Controller]] and [[class-CharacterJoint|Character Joint]] - Used to make character controllers.
* [[class-WheelCollider|Wheel Collider]] - A special collider for grounded vehicles.
* [[class-SkinnedCloth | Skinned Cloth]] - Used to create Skinned cloth
* [[class-InteractiveCloth | Interactive Cloth]] - Used to create Interactive cloths, this is just normal cloth being simulated.
