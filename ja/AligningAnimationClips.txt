!Aligning animation clips

Working with animation clips is easy in Mecanim. 

||PROPS
||``Name`` ||The name of the clip.||
||``Source Take`` ||The take in the source file to use as a source for this animation clip.||
||``Start`` ||Start frame of the clip.||
||``End`` ||End frame of the clip.||
||``Loop Pose``  ||Enable to make the motion loop seamlessly.||
||``Cycle Offset``  ||Offset to the cycle of a looping animation, if a different time in it is desired to be the start.||
||``Root Transform Rotation`` || || 
||>>>``Bake into Pose`` ||Enable to make root rotation be baked into the movement of the bones. Disable to make root rotation be stored as root motion.|| 
||>>>``Based Upon`` ||What the root rotation is based upon.||
||>>> >>>``Original``||Keeps the rotation as it is authored in the source file.||
||>>> >>>``Body Orientation`` ||Keeps the upper body pointing forward.||
||>>>``Offset`` ||Offset in degrees to the root rotation.||
||``Root Transform Position (Y)`` || || 
||>>>``Bake into Pose`` ||Enable to make vertical root motion be baked into the movement of the bones. Disable to make vertical root motion be stored as root motion.|| 
||>>>``Based Upon`` ||What the vertical root position is based upon.||
||>>> >>>``Original`` ||Keeps the vertical position as it is authored in the source file.||
||>>> >>>``Center of Mass`` ||Keeps the center of mass aligned with root transform position.||
||>>> >>>``Feet``||Keeps the feet aligned with the root transform position.||
||>>>``Offset`` ||Offset to the vertical root position.||
||``Root Transform Position (XZ)`` || || 
||>>>``Bake into Pose`` ||Enable to make horizontal root motion be baked into the movement of the bones. Disable to make horizontal root motion be stored as root motion.|| 
||>>>``Based Upon`` ||What the horizontal root position is based upon.||
||>>> >>>``Original`` ||Keeps the horizontal position as it is authored in the source file.||
||>>> >>>``Center of Mass`` ||Keeps the center of mass aligned with the root transform position.||
||>>>``Offset`` ||Offset to the horizontal root position.||
||``Mirror`` ||Mirror left and right in this clip.||
||``Body Mask`` ||The Body mask applied to this animation clip (see section on [[AvatarBodyMask|body masks]]).||
||``Curves`` (Unity Pro only)||Parameter-related curves (see [[AnimatorCurves|Curves in Mecanim]]).||
