!Inspector

Games in Unity are made up of multiple $$GameObjects$$ that contain meshes, scripts, sounds, or other graphical elements like $$Lights$$. The $$Inspector$$ displays detailed information about your currently selected GameObject, including all attached $$Components$$ and their properties. Here, you modify the functionality of GameObjects in your scene. You can read more about the [[GameObjects | GameObject-Component relationship]], as it is very important to understand.

Any property that is displayed in the Inspector can be directly modified.  Even script variables can be changed without modifying the script itself.  You can use the Inspector to change variables at runtime to experiment and find the magic gameplay for your game.  In a script, if you define a public variable of an object type (like GameObject or Transform), you can drag and drop a GameObject or Prefab into the Inspector to make the assignment.
