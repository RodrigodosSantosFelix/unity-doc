!Customizing the Unity Web Player loading screen

Customize the loading screen with ''UnityObject2'' is similiar to the way it's done with [[CustomizingtheUnityWebPlayerloadingscreen|UnityObject]].

Please note that modifying the loader images is only possible with $$Unity Pro$$.

Here is an example script that customizes the appearance of the Unity Web Player loading screen. The background color is set to light gray (``A0A0A0``), border color to black (``000000``), text color to white (``FFFFFF``) and loader images to ``MyLogo.png``, ``MyProgressBar.png`` and ``MyProgressFrame.png``. 
[@
var params = {
	backgroundcolor: "A0A0A0",
	bordercolor: "000000",
	textcolor: "FFFFFF",
	logoimage: "MyLogo.png",
	progressbarimage: "MyProgressBar.png",
	progressframeimage: "MyProgressFrame.png"
};
var u = UnityObject2({ params: params });
u.initPlugin(jQuery("#unityPlayer")[0], "Example.unity3d");
@]

See [[WorkingwithUnityObject2#constructor|UnityObject2]] for more details.
