! Importing Objects From Lightwave

You can import meshes and animations from Lightwave in two different ways:

* Using the FBX plugin for Lightwave
* Importing lightwave scene files using the Lightwave App Link

!! Unity currently imports

# All nodes with position, rotation and scale. Pivot points and Names are also imported.
# Meshes with UVs and normals.
# Materials with Texture and diffuse color. Multiple materials per mesh.
# Animations.
# Bone-based animations.

!! FBX Export

From Lightwave version 11 onwards the FBX 2012 exporter is now included:

Attach:LW_FBX.png

__FBX Filename__ : This file can contain multiple objects, Choose a filename and save to your \assets directory

__Anim Layer__ :

__Type__ : Choose Binary to reduce filesize or ASCII for a text editable FBX

__FBX Version__ Select 201200 from the drop down to ensure version 2012.1

__Export :__ Select all the elements you wish to include - not cameras and lights are not read into Unity

__Mesh type__ Choose Cage Subdivision if * otherwise choose subdivided to *

__Bake Motion Envelopes__

__Start frame / End frame__

__Scale Scene__ Set a scale for your scene applicable to match Unity


Once added to LightWave, the plugin is acessible via the Generics menu (on the Utiliies) tab.  If the Generic menu is not present you will have to add it using the Config Menus panel. In the latter panel it can be found in the Plug-ins category and is called "Generic Plugins". Add it to any convenient menu (see the LightWave manual for more details on how to do this).

More information about installation can also be found in the release notes that can downloaded with the installer.

!! Exporting

All objects and animations have to be exported from Layout (there is no Modeler FBX exporter).

!!!3. Switch to Unity.

* Unity will automatically import the fbx file and generate materials for the textures.
* Drag the imported fbx file from the Project view into the Scene view.

!!Important notes

*  You must select ``Embed Textures`` in the FBX panel when exporting or no UVs are exported
*  If you want to export animations you must enable ``Animations`` and either ``Camera`` or ``Lights``.
*  It is strongly recommended to always place your textures in a folder called "Textures" next to the fbx file. This will guarantee that Unity can always find the Texture and automatically connect the texture to the material.
