! Extending the Editor

You can create your own custom design tools inside Unity through $$Editor Windows$$.  Scripts that derive from [[ScriptRef:EditorWindow.html | EditorWindow]] instead of [[ScriptRef:MonoBehaviour.html | MonoBehaviour]] can leverage both [[ScriptRef:EditorGUI.html | GUI]]/[[ScriptRef:GUI.html | GUILayout]] and [[ScriptRef:GUILayout.html | EditorGUI]]/[[ScriptRef:EditorGUILayout.html | EditorGUILayout]] controls. Alternatively, you can use $$Custom Inspectors$$ to expose these GUI controls in your GameObject Inspector.

!! [[editor-EditorWindows | Editor Windows]]
You can create your own custom windows in Unity that you can use to edit and author your game more efficiently.

!! [[editor-PropertyDrawers | Property Drawers]]
PropertyDrawers can be used to customize the look of certain controls in the Inspector, by using attributes on your scripts, or by controlling how a specific Serializable class should look.

!! [[editor-CustomEditors | Custom Editors]]
Custom editors can be used to customize what a component looks like in the Inspector and in the Scene View.
