! iOS Scripting

Unity iOS provides a number of new scripting APIs to access unique device functionality. For cross-platform projects, UNITY_IPHONE is defined for conditionally compiling iOS-specific C# code. The following new scripting classes were introduced:
||[[ScriptRef:iPhoneInput.html | iPhoneInput]] ||Access to multi-touch screen, accelerometer, device orientation and geographical location.
||[[ScriptRef:iPhoneSettings.html | iPhoneSettings]] ||iOS specific settings, such as screen orientation, dimming and information about device hardware.
||[[ScriptRef:iPhoneKeyboard.html | iPhoneKeyboard]] ||Support for native on-screen keyboard.
||[[ScriptRef:iPhoneUtils.html | iPhoneUtils]] ||Useful functions for movie playback, anti-piracy protection and vibration.
