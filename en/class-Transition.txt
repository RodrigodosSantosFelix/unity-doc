!!Animation Transitions

$$Animation Transitions$$ define ''what'' happens when you switch from one $$Animation State$$ to another. There can be only one transition active at any given time. 

||PROPS
||``Atomic``      ||Is this transition atomic? (cannot be interrupted)
||``Conditions``    ||Here we decide ''when'' transitions get triggered. 

A condition consists of 2 parts: 
# A conditional predicate (``If``, ``If Not``, ``Less``, ``Greater``, ``Equals``, ``Not Equal``, and ``Exit Time``). 
# An event parameter (in conjunction with ``If`` and ``If Not``, use bool parameters, ``Exit Time`` just uses time). 
# A parameter value (if needed)

You can adjust the transition between the two animation clips by dragging the start and end values of the overlap.
